This is the preferred size \nsince it produces a good balance of big sized \u0026 small \nsized seed tubers\n• Number of sprouts should be at least 4\n• Seed tubers are kept in diffuse light to allow development of short strong sprouts: this is to ensure a  uniform stand\n• Production of basic seed is undertaken by KARI Tigoni\n• Bulking of basic seed is done by various organizations such as ADC Farm in Molo, Kisima Farm in Meru and selected individual farmers."
